    title: discovery
    desc: The discovery stage is the most important. During this stage, we will get to know about your project in great detail. We get to know everything we can about the project and form a clear project definition. This definition consists of a project summary, goals, target audiences, and ofcourse, the intended message. This is where we find out if we are a good fit and then find out everything we can.
